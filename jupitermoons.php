                            <p>Jupiter has 67 known moons. The four largest moons are called the Galilean satellites, after Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, who observed them in 1610. The German astronomer Simon Marius claimed to have seen the moons around the same time, but he did not publish his observations and so Galileo is given the credit for their discovery. Some of Jupiter's moons, especially Europa, are believed to have the potential of hosting life. </p>

As Io travels in its slightly elliptical orbit, Jupiter's immense gravity causes "tides" in the solid surface that rise 100 m (300 feet) high on Io, generating enough heat for volcanic activity and to drive off any water. Io's volcanoes are driven by hot silicate magma.</p>

                                    <p>Ganymede was discovered by Galileo Galilei on Jan. 7, 1610. The discovery, along with three otherJovian moons, was the first time a moon was discovered orbiting a planet other than Earth. Galileo’s discovery eventually led to the understanding that planets orbit the sun, instead of our solar system revolving around Earth. Early Chinese astronomical records also show the discovery of a moon of Jupiter, which was most likely the first observation of Ganymede. </p>
